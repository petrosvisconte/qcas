# Quantitative Condor Analytical System (QCAS)
A continuation of my final project from Mathematical Modeling: https://github.com/petrosvisconte/MATH351

QCAS determines the optimal market-wide Iron Condor option trades using statistical analysis, probability theory, and machine learning. By integrating real-time market data, historical trends, and volatility patterns, QCAS provides high-probability Iron Condor setups with the best expected long term profits. 

### Best Assets
QCAS begins by compiling a market-wide list of assets best suited for the Iron Condor strategy.
